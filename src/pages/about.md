Hi! I'm Oliver. I work at [The Financial Times](https://ft.com) as the Tech Lead on the Advertising and Privacy team, where I'm having a blast building out a new advertising platform for the FT Group. You can read more about that journey in this series of articles on [_Project Gwyneth_](/articles/project-gwyneth).

I got into software development (after deciding I didn't want to be a barrister) in about 2007 because I wanted to help make the web more accessible; fifteen years later that aspiration continues to guide & inspire. From designing and documenting Cloud architecture and scalable APIs, to authoring maintainable CSS and accessible markup, and from thinking about testable systems to observability, I love building for the web.

In my free time I co-organise [London CSS](https://londoncss.dev), coach at [Codebar](https://codebar.io), and teach myself new tricks by building projects with tools, frameworks and technologies I find interesting. You can see a list of some of the things I've built on [my projects page](/projects).

My wife and I live in North London together with Lesley the Fox. You can follow Lesley's adventures on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/harringayfoxfam) (warning: danger of cute overload).

If you would like to natter, I can be found on [Mastodon](https://toot.cafe/oliverturner). If you're interested working together, my resum√© is available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-turner-68846313/).
