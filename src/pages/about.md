Hi! I'm Oliver. I don't know whether I really believe in the term "full-stack", but I do know that I love CSS just as much as I enjoy designing Cloud architecture, building APIs or optimising performance. I got into web development (after deciding I didn't want to be a barrister) in about 2007 because I wanted to help make the web more accessible, a calling that continues to inspire me to this day.

I work at [The Financial Times](https://ft.com) in the Advertising and Privacy team, where I'm having a blast building a new ad platform for the FT Group. You can read more about that journey in [this series of articles on _Project Gwyneth_](/articles/project-gwyneth).

In my free time I co-organise of [London CSS](https://londoncss.dev), coach at [Codebar](https://codebar.io), and teach myself new tricks by building projects with tools, frameworks and technologies I find interesting.

My wife and I live in North London together with Lesley the fox. You can follow Lesley's adventures on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/harringayfoxfam) (warning: danger of cute overload).

If you want to get in touch, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://toot.cafe/oliverturner) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-turner-68846313/).
